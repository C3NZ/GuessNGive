#GuessNGive

##Details
A simple game I made to put what I've learned about C++ so far into use. 

##The game has two different game modes you can play:
1. Guessing game
	*The computer generates a random number between the numbers 1 and 100 which you have to guess
2. Giving game
	*You give the computer a number between 1 and 100 and then the computer tries and guesses it	

##Demonstrates mostly the use of...
*Conditional statements
*Logical operators
*iostream file functions
*generating random numbers and seeding the random number generator
